# AustraliaPost
A Craft Commerce shipping calculator plugin for Australia Post.

**Please note**

This plugin was developed for a specific use-case and specifically for use with Australia Post. It's primarily here as a resource, and will not be supported. Please feel free to fork and implement your own provider (USPS, Fedex, etc).

For a more flexible solution with multiple providers, look at [Postie](https://github.com/engram-design/Postie).
